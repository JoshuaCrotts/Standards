 * Standards is the long-overdue update to the everlasting Standards 2.0 library
 * Andrew Matzureff and I created two years ago. I am including it in this project
 * to simplify the rendering and logic pipeline, but with a focus on the MVC
 * paradigm.
 *
 * We connect to the Apache FastMath API for some of our trigonometric functions,
 * and we use John Carmack's fast inverse square root function. Lastly, for
 * StandardAudio, we use the javax.sound (Trail's Sound) Oracle API.
