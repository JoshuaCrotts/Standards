# Standards
Standards is the new (and revived) version of the former Standards 1.0/2.0 library. It is based in Java, and includes all the basic materials and code necessary to create a basic game.

# Usage
The version of Standards under the **master** branch is the public release version. Additionally, the **development** branch contains test and in-progress code. There may be game-breaking features in these versions, so use them at your own risk.
